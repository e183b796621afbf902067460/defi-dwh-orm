# DeFi DWH ORM

Depends on: [defi-head-core](https://github.com/e183b796621afbf902067460/defi-head-core).

DeFi ORM is an object-relational mapper that provides transparent persistence for __Python__ objects based on __SQLalchemy__. One of it's key features is the option to write database queries in a proprietary object oriented SQL dialect. This provides developers with a powerful alternative to SQL that maintains flexibility without requiring unnecessary code duplication.

# Configuration
To provide needed configuration just need to set environment variables for your local DB credentials in [configuration module](https://github.com/e183b796621afbf902067460/defi-dwh-orm/blob/master/cfg/engine.py).

# Usage
Just run simple [test case](https://github.com/e183b796621afbf902067460/defi-dwh-orm/blob/master/tests/test_.py) to fill your local DB with fixtures and check that the tests worked successfully.
